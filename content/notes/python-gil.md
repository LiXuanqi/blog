## What is the GIL?

The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) is a mutex that prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously, even on multi-core systems. Essentially, only one thread can run Python code at a time.

## Why does it exist?

The GIL was introduced to solve thread safety issues with Python's reference counting memory management system. Python objects have reference counts that track how many variables point to them. Without the GIL, multiple threads could modify these counts simultaneously, leading to memory corruption or premature object deallocation.

## Recent developments

Python 3.13 introduced an experimental "free-threaded" mode that disables the GIL. This feature is opt-in and not recommended for production use, as it may actually reduce performance for single-threaded applications due to additional thread-safety overhead.

## GIL cannot prevent race condition

The GIL provides limited protection against race conditions, but it's not designed to be a comprehensive solution and shouldn't be relied upon for thread safety.

Because the GIL operates at the bytecode level, it only prevents race conditions for simple operations that are atomic at the bytecode level, such as basic variable reads/writes or simple arithmetic.

```python
counter += 1  # This is actually: LOAD, ADD, STORE - three operations
```
