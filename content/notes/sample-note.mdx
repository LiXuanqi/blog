# Sample Note

This is a sample note in the notes section. Notes are meant to be shorter, more informal posts compared to full blog articles.

## Quick Thoughts

- Notes can contain bullet points
- They support all the same MDX features as blog posts
- Perfect for capturing quick insights or learning snippets

```javascript
// Even code snippets work in notes
const quickTip = "Notes are great for documenting learning";
console.log(quickTip);
```

Math expressions work too: $E = mc^2$
